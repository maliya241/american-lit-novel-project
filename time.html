        <h2>Time Period</h2>
          <p>Even though postmodernism does not have a definite definition, it can be described in general. Similar to modernism, it rejects the distinction between high and low forms of art and rigid genres. It celebrates the lack of meaning in a world of chaos which opposes modernism’s mourning of the world’s meaninglessness (Klages). It believes in relative reality as it rejects a universal explanation of reality. Our interpretations and experiences set our reality (“Post Modernism”).</p>
          <p>The literary focus of postmodernism is that the characters change and mold to problems they can not conquer (“Post Modernism”). In Kim Edwards’ <i>The Memory Keeper’s Daughter</i>, the Henry family, except Phoebe, had something to grieve which they could not conquer. Instead they found ways to cope with their grieving. For David Henry, he became more distant from his family and focused on his photography. Norah tried to forget about her grief by keeping herself busy with housework and a job. Music became Paul’s way to release his grief.</p>
          <p>Some techniques used in postmodern writing are metafiction, pastiche, and temporal distortion. Metafiction is the awareness and the emphasis on the fictiveness of a piece. Pastiche is a writing collage of style, techniques, themes, et cetera from different writings. Temporal distortion is defined as the jumps in time (“Post Modernism”). <i>The Memory Keeper’s Daughter</i> demonstrates this through time skips and flashbacks.</p>
          <p>Themes of postmodernism include ambiguity, discontinuity, fragmentation (Klages), irony, paranoia, playfulness (“Post Modernism”), self-consciousness, and simultaneity (Klages). Some of these themes can be found in <i>The Memory Keeper’s Daughter</i>. Irony plays an important part of the story. Because he views a child not in perfect condition as a bearer of grief and brokenness, David Henry gives away his child with Down’s syndrome in hopes to avoid the grief and brokenness he felt with his sickly sister who died at an early age. However, his choice brings what he tried to prevent. Fragmentation is shown through his family’s brokenness. Moreover, the child he believed to be bearer of grief and brokenness brings together people to make a family.</p>
